        The century-old PSG Sarvajana Higher Secondary School is situated in the salubrious climate of Peelamedu in Coimbatore. It has made remarkable strides in terms of physical growth, academic feats and also in the field of sports. It is difficult to bring into the narrow compass of history, all its accomplishments and achievements.
        Swami Vivekananda said, “The aim of education is the attainment of human excellence”. Having this perspective in mind, the school moulds the children in a harmonious and positive way. It amalgamates scholastic and co-curricular activities while grounded in our cultural and moral values.
        The catalyst that drives the Faculty of the school is the motto <strong>“Serve and Smile”</strong>, which ensures that the children are nurtured and empowered to contribute to the world as global leaders.
